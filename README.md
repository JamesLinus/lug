lug
===
`lug` is a compact embedded DSL for expressing parsers as Parsing Expression Grammars in C++.

TODO
---
- Settle on a better memory management scheme for the parsing rules during grammar construction
- Implement variable scoping for the L-Attribute grammar operator bound to a rule expression
- Experiment with reimplementing as a virtual parsing machine via *A Parsing Machine for PEGs, Medeiros et al.*
- Add documentation
- More samples and testing
